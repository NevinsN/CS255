Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
- The client was DriverPass's owner, who ran a company dedicated to helping people prepare for and pass their driver's tests. They wanted a new user system to help with scheduling, payment, testing, studying, and so on.

What did you do particularly well?
- I feel like I came up with the basic functions of the system pretty well. I liked developing the logic and processes that needed to work together in order for the system to work.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- My diagramming in general was weaker than I would ideally like. It was mostly a product of time, and not having it to really dig into the diagrams and make them more thorough. I would like to go in and spend more time creating more meaningful and complete diagrams.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- At the end of the day, if the user doesn't like or can't figure out how to use a system, then the system is a failure. It doesn't matter how much thought was put into it, or how well it was designed in other aspects. Usability by the user is everything. For this project, I had the input form the DriverPass staff on what a user should be able to do, and I was able to take that interview and break it down into good use cases to design around and make a system that is user friendly and accomplishes what DriverPass asked for.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- I try very hard to approach software design from an OOP mindest, and work out what components and classes are going to be necessary in order for the program to perform properly. Going forward, I intend to keep approaching design like this. Moreover, I think taking with me principles like deconstructing systems and subsystems and diagramming use cases will be invaluable as I further develop my skills and career.
